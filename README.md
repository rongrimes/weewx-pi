# weewx-pi
I have the following hardware:
* Weatherflow Tempest
* raspberrypi zero 2

... with a goal to integrate and broadcast over public weather networks:
* Weatherflow Tempest
* Weather Underground
* AWEKAS
* Weathercloud
* weewx weather reporting
* WOW

This document what I have done to bring this all about.

/Full disclosure/ :)  
I have had the *Tempest*  running through a raspberrypi4 2 GB platform for 9 months and it has been very stable throught out this time.

Reason for change
