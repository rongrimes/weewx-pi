# weewx-pi
I have the following hardware:
* Weatherflow Tempest
* Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

... with a goal to integrate and broadcast over public weather networks:
* Weatherflow Tempest
* Weather Underground
* AWEKAS
* Weathercloud
* weewx weather reporting
* WOW

This document is what I have done to bring this all about.

/Full disclosure/ :)  
I have had the *Tempest* running with weewx software on a raspberrypi4 2 GB platform for 9 months. I think that a better $ value is to have weewx running on a Pi Zero. 

This documdent is being written as I convert the station from the Pi 4 to Pi Zero.
