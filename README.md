## Introduction

This note describes setting up a **Raspberry Pi** to process the results from a **Weather Flow Tempest**.

I have the following hardware:

| Weatherflow Tempest | Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W |
|---|---|
| <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0012/8512/8294/products/Tempest_Hub_Mount_shopify-amazon-2020_1024x1024@2x.png" width="200"> | <img src="https://assets.raspberrypi.com/static/51035ec4c2f8f630b3d26c32e90c93f1/2b8d7/zero2-hero.webp" width="200"> |

... with a goal to integrate and broadcast over public weather networks:
* Weatherflow Tempest
* Weather Underground
* AWEKAS
* Weathercloud
* weewx weather reporting
* WOW

### Full disclosure :)  
I have had the _Tempest_ running with _weewx_ software on a raspberrypi4 2 GB platform for 9 months. I think that a better $ value is to have weewx running on a Pi Zero. 

This documdent is being written as I convert the station from the Pi 4 to Pi Zero. Since I m converting from an existing system, I may leave a few bits out. If they are annoying, or the document could be improved, please let me know. If otherwise, then, just Sorry!
